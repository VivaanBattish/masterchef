Step 1. Prepare your ingredients.  Measure your water and coffee beans.

We recommend the ratio of 28g of coffee for every 12 oz of water. Measured by volume, that’s about 4 tablespoons of ground coffee to 1.5 cups of water. But you can make it stronger or weaker to your taste.


Step 2. Grind the coffee. Grind coffee to a coarse ground. (If you’re using pre-ground coffee, you can skip this step.)


Step 3. Fill the kettle & set to boil. Pour measured water into kettle and turn on to boil.


Step 4. Add coffee grounds to filter. While water is boiling, add coffee grounds to the filter. Here we show the grounds in a permanent filter.

Step 5. Get the correct temperature of water. Once the water has boiled, wait about 30 seconds before pouring so that the water has settled down slightly from its active boiling temperature. This is called “off boil” water.


Step 6. Blooming. Bloom the coffee grounds by pouring enough water to wet all of the grounds. You’ll see the coffee is blooming because it will bubble. Stop pouring the water and let the coffee bloom for 30 seconds.


Step 7. Begin your brew pour. Pour water steadily and evenly over grounds. We recommend using a clockwise motion starting at the middle and moving towards the edge, and back to center. Keep repeating that pattern, pouring the water at a rate that will not “flood” the grounds but will keep them submerged in water.


Step 9. Remove filter & grounds.


Step 10. Serve & enjoy. Pour coffee into your favorite coffee mug and enjoy. Drink it black or with any of your favorite coffee bar additions.
